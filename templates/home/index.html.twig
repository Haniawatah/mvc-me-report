            <p>
                Hey there! I'm currently studying at BTH and slowly working my way through this MVC course. 
                It's been quite the challenge so far - I've stayed up way too late debugging stuff that should've been simple!
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided to make this site entirely in English this time around because, honestly, I need the practice.
                Plus, it makes it easier to share with my non-Swedish speaking friends who might want to see what I've been 
                complaining about working on these past few weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not battling with Symfony routes and configurations, I enjoy hiking and playing video games - 
                both good ways to forget about broken code for a while!
            </p>

            <p>
                Hello! I'm a student at Blekinge Institute of Technology taking the MVC course.
                Here I'll be documenting my journey through the course and showcasing the projects
                I develop along the way. This time my website will contain only English content :)
            </p>
            <p>
                This site was built using the Symfony framework and showcases various MVC concepts
                that I'll learn throughout this course.
            </p>

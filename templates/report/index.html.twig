            During the first week of the MVC course, I got my Symfony project up and running and started to get a feel for how an MVC (Model-View-Controller) application is structured. It was a bit overwhelming at first, but also really exciting to finally see how all the pieces fit together.
        </p>
        <p>
            I created my first routes, controllers, and templates, and managed to build a simple but working website. That hands-on experience helped a lot. I also got introduced to Twig, Symfony's templating engine, which was actually really nice to work with — it keeps things clean and readable when you want to mix HTML with dynamic content.
        </p>
        <p>
            What stood out to me was how Symfony encourages you to follow best practices from the beginning. The framework provides a clear structure and useful tools that make it easier to stay organized, even as your project grows. It's a bit strict in some ways, but I can see how that's helpful in the long run.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I've learned a lot this week — not just about Symfony, but also about the MVC pattern in general and how web apps are built in a more professional way. There's still a lot to explore, like working with databases and models, but I'm looking forward to diving deeper in the coming weeks.
